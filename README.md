# Knox: A Narrative Universe

Welcome to the central development hub for the **Knox** narrative universe, created by Michael Ragsdale (raggiesoft). This project encompasses the world-building, future narratives, and the web technologies used to present them.

## The Premise

On the oppressive, high-gravity jungle world of **Telsus Minor**, located in the unaligned Telsan Gap, the monopolistic **Axiom corporation** rules through economic force. Their operations are plagued by a phantom saboteur they call **"Knox"**â€”a myth they believe to be a single, highly-trained ex-military operative.

But the Axiom hunts a ghost of their own making. The reality is far more dangerous: **Anya and Kael Rostova**, young fraternal twins raised in the hidden canopy villages of "The Weave," wage a secret war using scavenged technology, improvised chemistry, and an intimate knowledge of the lethal environment the Axiom dismisses as the "Green Hell."

## Project Architecture

This narrative universe is presented across multiple, interconnected websites, each with a distinct purpose:

- **`https://raggiesoftknox.com/` (Main Site):** The primary welcome page and central hub, introducing the world and linking to the other sites. Built with custom PHP.
    
- **`https://lore.raggiesoftknox.com/` (Lore Bible):** Hosts the detailed world-building information (characters, locations, factions, technology). Powered by WordPress with a custom theme.
    
- **`https://pact.raggiesoftknox.com/` (Narrative - Twins' POV):** Intended to host the story told from the perspective of Anya and Kael. (Technology TBD - likely custom PHP).
    
- **`https://port.raggiesoftknox.com/` (Narrative - Axiom POV):** Intended to host the story told from the perspective of Axiom personnel (like Auditors or Whispers). (Technology TBD - likely custom PHP).
    

## Technology Stack

This project utilizes a polyglot microservices architecture hosted primarily on DigitalOcean:

- **Frontend (Main Site):** Custom PHP (using `elara.php` front controller), HTML, CSS.
    
- **Frontend (Lore Site):** WordPress, Custom Theme, PHP.
    
- **UI Components:** Web Awesome Pro 3.0 (Web Components), Font Awesome Pro (Icons).
    
- **Backend Services:**
    
    - **Music API:** Java (Spring Boot) - Scans file system, serves album/track data as JSON.
        
    - **Content API (Planned):** Python (FastAPI with SQLAlchemy) - Serves lore data from a database.
        
- **Database:** MariaDB (Hosted on a dedicated DigitalOcean Droplet - `elara.raggiesoft.com`).
    
- **Asset Hosting:** DigitalOcean Spaces (CDN via `assets.raggiesoft.com`).
    
- **Web Server:** Nginx (Self-managed on Ubuntu Droplet - `glowing-galaxy.raggiesoft.com`).
    
- **Security:** Cloudflare (DNS, potentially WAF), UFW, Fail2Ban, Bastion Host (`sentinel-star.raggiesoft.com`), SSH Key Authentication.
    
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub.
    
- **Deployment:** Custom Bash script (`deploy.sh`) using `git pull`.
    

## Repository Structure & Version Control

**(When Completed)** This project employs **separate Git repositories** for each distinct website component to maintain modularity and ease deployment, hosted under the `raggiesoft` GitHub account:

- `raggiesoft/knox-main`: For `raggiesoftknox.com`
    
- `raggiesoft/knox-lore`: For `lore.raggiesoftknox.com` (WordPress theme, etc.)
    
- `raggiesoft/knox-pact`: For `pact.raggiesoftknox.com`
    
- `raggiesoft/knox-port`: For `port.raggiesoftknox.com`
    
- _(Repositories for Java API, Python API, etc. will also be separate)_
    

A separate, consolidated repository exists for course requirements (`ITD-210/course-project-raggiesoft`) which may utilize Git Submodules to reference these individual project repositories.
