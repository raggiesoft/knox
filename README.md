# Knox: A Narrative Universe

Welcome to the official repository for the Knox narrative universe. This project serves as the world-building bible and future home for a story set on the oppressive, high-gravity world of Telsus Minor.

The Axiom corporation hunts a phantom they call 'Knox'â€”a master saboteur haunting their operations. But the myth is a lie, and the reality is far more dangerous.

## About This Repository

This repository contains two distinct types of work, each governed by its own license:

The Narrative & Creative Content: All lore, character profiles, story text, and world-building details. This is the creative heart of the project.

The Website Source Code: The underlying PHP, JavaScript, and other code used to present the narrative on its future website.

## Dual-Licensing

This project is dual-licensed to respect the difference between creative work and software.

Narrative Content: The story, characters, and all world-building text are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. You are free to share and adapt this work, even for commercial purposes, as long as you give appropriate credit and distribute your contributions under the same license.

Source Code: All underlying source code for the website is licensed under the MIT License. This is a permissive license that allows for broad reuse.

## Technical Overview

The website is built using a lightweight, custom PHP "front controller" (anya.php) that handles routing. The front-end uses modern, framework-agnostic Web Components (<rs-audio-player>) and is styled with Web Awesome / Font Awesome. All static assets (CSS, JS, music, images) are intended to be hosted on a CDN for performance.
